Mach 1 March Results Application v1.0

This app takes in data from both the group stage and final stage, and outputs a runner's win/loss record and their average and best times for a level.

USAGE:
In its current state, you'll need to run the program from the command line. Open Windows command prompt or powershell and navigate to the file location. Enter the command java -jar M1m-Results-App.jar
It should print out "Done reading results", then "Enter runner name: ". At this point you can type in the runner's name (case doesn't matter), then type in the level when asked. Certain levels will also ask if played on NCS.
The program will keep asking for new runner names until you type exit, quit, or close the command line.

Change Log:
Version 1.0 - Works on command line for group stage and bracket.
